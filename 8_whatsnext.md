# Ansible AWX Guide: from scratch to REST API (8/8)

## What's Next

You can increase your security access to REST API using OAuth 2 Token Authentication method instead Basic HTTP:  
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/oauth2_token_auth.html>

It is very recommended that you use dynamic inventories instead static inventories (e.g. AWS EC2):  
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html>

- So, do you already know how to automate your application using Ansible?
- What about your pipeline?
- How are you kickstarting your machines?
- How are you preparing your environment?

In this article I've demonstrated how to interact with Ansible AWX making adjustments in static inventory with tools like tower-cli and curl, then created the workflow in AWX that shows how to automate interactions using playbooks.

This article is also published in my [GitHub](https://github.com/cdomingos/article-towerawx-restapi-inventory).

I hope you enjoy it!
